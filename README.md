# milestones

A learning project in React Native:

Aim is to create a web/mobile app that can keep track of a user's milestones (i.e. days gone without eating cake, hours gone without cursing) and tie them with the user's account. This way, a user can access the app via mobile and web, and see the same data.

The user can look at past 'streaks' through graphs and see their longest 'streak' to date.

Will implement with social media logins so the user doesn't have to create yet ANOTHER account for an app.

Thinking of using Twitter API or Twilio API that can send friendly reminders or notifications of progress.

User data will be stored using Firebase SDK.
